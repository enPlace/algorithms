#Insertion Sort Algorithm. 

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. 

We'll start with position [1] in our array iterate through each subsequent item in the array. For each item we'll check to see if it is smaller than the previous item, and if so, move it to the left, and move the previous item to the right. This will take another loop which we will perform until the item we are assessing is not smaller than the previous item in the array.
